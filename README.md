The task of regression is to predict output labels which are continuous numeric values for the given input data.


Regression is a statistical technique used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal of regression analysis is to understand and quantify the relationship between variables, as well as to make predictions based on that relationship.
